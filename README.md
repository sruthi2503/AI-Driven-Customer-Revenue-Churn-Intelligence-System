# AI-Driven Customer Revenue & Churn Intelligence System

🚀 **This is not a basic sales dashboard.**  
This project goes beyond descriptive analytics to identify **why customers churn**, **which customers are at risk**, and **what business actions can prevent revenue loss**.

## 📌 Business Problem

Company revenue is stagnating despite stable customer acquisition.

**Key questions answered:**
- Which customers are likely to churn?
- What factors contribute most to churn?
- Who are the high-value customers worth retaining?
- How can the business reduce revenue leakage?

## 🧮 SQL Analysis (MySQL)

Performed deep customer analytics using optimized SQL queries:

- Monthly churn rate
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
- Cohort retention analysis
- High-value customer identification

**Advanced SQL Concepts Used:**
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions
- Subqueries
- Indexing (performance optimization)

## 🤖 Machine Learning (Python)

### Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

### ML Tasks
- Churn prediction
- Feature importance analysis (why customers churn)
- Customer segmentation using K-Means
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Recall, Confusion Matrix)

**Outcome:**  
Identified high-risk churn customers and key churn drivers such as tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.
